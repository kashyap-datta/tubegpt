# TubeGPT Frontend

TubeGPT is a web application that leverages OpenAI's GPT API and an unofficial YouTube Transcript API to summarize/learn more about YouTube videos.

## Features

- Users can paste a YouTube link in the search bar to process the video.
- The application provides a ChatGPT-style interface that allows users to ask questions about the video content.
- Users can ask follow-up questions based on the video's content.

## Example Chat Questions

Here are some example questions you can ask:

- "Summarize this video."
- "What is the video about?"
- "What are three things I can learn from it?"
  
## Note
This repository is a personal endeavor and serves as a learning experiment. It is not a complete, production-ready application but rather a demonstration of technical skills and curiosity for AI and natural language processing.

The project is a work-in-progress, and there is room for improvement and expansion. While the current implementation showcases the core functionality, it requires further refinement to be considered a fully robust application.

I hope you find this project an exciting representation of my enthusiasm for exploring cutting-edge technologies and their potential applications. Please feel free to provide feedback, and thank you for taking the time to review my work.
